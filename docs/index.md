# Topoquery

**Topoquery** is a simple query system to create and manipulate states of networks and graphs.

*"But why ?"*, you may wonder. Because there is no simple, portable and lightweight language to write and store networks - to our knowledge at least (if you know one, please [let us know](https://github.com/topogram/topoquery/issues/2)).

## How it Works

It is super simple : you input **queries** in plain text or via command-line to select nodes / edges and apply actions on them (add, delete, show, hide, etc).

It works with node or in the browser -- see the [`/examples`](/examples) folder.
